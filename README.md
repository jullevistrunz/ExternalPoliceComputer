# [ExternalPoliceComputer 1.4.0](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/45400-externalpolicecomputer/)

A Police Computer Plugin and Node.js Server for LSPDFR.

## Config

- File: `EPC/config.json`
- `useStopThePed`: If set to `true` and STP is installed, EPC will use registration and insurance data generated by STP; If set to `false`, EPC will generate registration and insurance data (resulting in different results)
- `useLSPDFROwner`: If set to `true`, EPC will use the owner of a vehicle generated by LSPDFR (resulting in the owner possibly coming back as not found when searching); If set to `false`, EPC will generate the owner of a vehicle (resulting in different results)
- `wordForJail`: obsolete; use language.json instead
- `currency`: obsolete; use language.json instead
- `showCurrentID`: If set to `true`, EPC will show the ID of peds you ask, arrest, or pat down; I recommend you set this to `false` on most mobile devices
- `autoShowCurrentID`: If set to `true`, IDs will pop up automatically; If set to `false`, you'll have the option to show/hide the current ID
- `warningColorsForPedCarSearch`: If set to `true`, expired registration/insurance, outstanding warrants, etc. will be displayed in a warning color
- If you create your own `custom.js` file, you may add variables here (path: `/data/config`)
- `arrestedWithWarrantChance`: The probability someone has prior arrests, if they have a warrant; value range: `0 - 1`
- `arrestedWithoutWarrantChance`: The probability someone has prior arrests, if they don't have a warrant; value range: `0 - 1`
- `additionalArrestChance`: The probability an additional prior arrest is added to someone who was defined to have prior arrests (see before); value range: `0 - 0.99`
- `citationChance`: The probability someone has prior citations; value range: `0 - 1`
- `additionalCitationChance`: The probability an additional prior citation is added to someone who was defined to have prior citations (see before); value range: `0 - 0.99`

- `paroleChance`: The probability someone who has a prior arrest is on parole if they are not on probation; value range: `0 - 1`
- `showCustomizationLink`: If set to `true` a link to the customization page will appear
- `replaceStaticWithCustomLanguage`: If set to `true`, EPC will use `EPC/language.json` to replace all static elements; Use this if you have a custom `EPC/language.json`
- `port`: The port used by the Node.js http server
- `defaultMapZoom`: Map zoom when the page loads
- `showCalloutPage`: `false` to disable the callout page; might be helpful for lower-end devices
- `autoShowCalloutPage`: If set to `true`, EPC will automatically switch to the callout page if a new callout is being displayed
- `updateCalloutPageInterval`: Interval in ms to update the callout page from the game's data
- `clearCalloutPageTime`: Time in ms to clear the callout page after the callout ended; `null` to never clear
- `automaticIncidentReports`: If set to `true`, EPC will create an incident report when a callout ends

## Citation and Arrest Options

## Custom Styles

You may change colors, size, etc. in the `:root` selector for simple customization. You can also add more css. `EPC/custom.css` will overwrite `EPC/main/styles.css`

## Custom JavaScript

- File: `EPC/custom.js`

You can add your own JS code if you know what you're doing. Versions made by me (or others) can be found on Discord

## Steam overlay

- In steam go to Steam <a>&rarr;</a> Settings <a>&rarr;</a> In Game
- Make sure _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ is enabled
- Set _Overlay shortcut key(s)_ to whatever key you want to use to open ExternalPoliceComputer
- Set _Web browser home page_ to `http://127.0.0.1`

## API

If you're a callout dev, you can send messages to EPC's callout page once the callout has been accepted

```c#
ExternalPoliceComputer.Functions.SendMessage("Additional Message");
```

Multiple lines are supported by using one of the two:

```c#
ExternalPoliceComputer.Functions.SendMessage("1st Line<br>2nd Line");
```

```c#
ExternalPoliceComputer.Functions.SendMessage("1st Line");
ExternalPoliceComputer.Functions.SendMessage("2nd Line");
```

You must add the ExternalPoliceComputer.dll as a reference in your project. To prevent crashes, you have to check if EPC is available ([Example by opus49](https://github.com/Immersive-Plugins-Team/CalloutInterfaceAPI/blob/master/CalloutInterfaceAPI/Functions.cs#L26)).
